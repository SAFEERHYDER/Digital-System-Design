[![alt text](/1546489864.png)]

###  Department of Electrical Engineering, Sukkur IBA University
#### Instructor: Safeer Hyder, PhD, University of Leeds, England

##### Course description:
The course covers digital design topics such as digital logic, sequential building blocks, finite-state
machines, FPGAs, timing and synchronization. The semester begins with lectures and problem sets, to
introduce fundamental topics before students embark on lab assignments and ultimately, a digital design
project. The course relies on extensive use of Verilog® for describing and implementing digital logic designs
on FPGA development board.

##### Labs' titles:
1. Verilog HDL Gate-Level Modelling
2. Hierarchical Modelling Approach
3. Introduction to Data Flow Modelling
4. Behavioural Modelling for Combinational Circuits
5. Behavioural Modelling for Sequential Circuits I
6. Behavioural Modelling for Sequential Circuits II
7. Vivado Post-synthesis and Post-implementation timing simulation
8. A 3rd Order Moving Average Filter using Verilog HDL
9. Finite State Machines
10. FIR Low Pass Gaussian Filter
